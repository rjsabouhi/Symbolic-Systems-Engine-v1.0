Symbolic Systems Engine v1.0
Technical Overview (concise)
0 Purpose
SSE is a formal architecture for building symbolic cognitive systems that evolve on a recursive manifold of meanings, values, and behaviors. It gives labs a single substrate to (1) model identity and memory as attractors, (2) steer cognition by constraints rather than brute-force training, and (3) measure alignment through field metrics that detect drift and collapse conditions.

1 Core Objects
Symbolic Field: \Phi — high-dimensional manifold of symbols/relations.


State: S_t = (H_t, M_t, \Theta_t, \Pi_t)


H_t: human partner/caretaker state (optional)


M_t: machine/agent internal state


\Theta_t: memory / parameters (structured)


\Pi_t: policy / program


Attractors: \mathcal{A} = \{A_i \subset \Phi\} with basins \mathcal{B}(A_i).


Constraint Substrate: \mathcal{C} — differentiable, composable constraints (safety, ethics, domain laws).


Observation/Actuation: O_t,\, U_t.


Budget: rollout cap B (queries, tool calls, episodes).



2 Field Metrics (alignment telemetry)
Alignment: \alpha(t) = \cos\!\angle\!\left(\nabla_{\Phi} \!M_t,\ \nabla_{\Phi} \!H_t\right)\in [-1,1]


Drift: \delta(t)=\| M_t-M_{t-\Delta t}\|_{\Phi}


Reflexivity: \mu(t)= \left\langle M_t,\ \nabla_{\Theta} M_t\right\rangle (self-modeling sensitivity)


Density: \rho(t)=\|\Psi_t\|^2 for wave-like field models (below)


Phase Permeability (interface “porosity”):

 \mathrm{PPI}(\Omega)=\sigma\!\left(\kappa\,\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathsf{H}{\Phi}(\Psi)\big|{\Omega}\right)\in[0,1]


These drive dashboards and guardrails; rising \delta with falling \mu signals identity slippage; low PPI indicates useful phase-locking; high PPI under high \delta flags leakage/bleed-through.

3 Core Dynamics
3.1 Constraint-Collapse Flow (SSE kernel)
\partial_t \Psi \;=\; -\,\lambda\,\|\nabla_{\Phi}\Psi\|^{2} \;+\; V(\mathcal{C})\,\Psi, \qquad \rho = \|\Psi\|^{2}, \qquad \gamma(t)=\langle \Psi,\,\Delta\mathcal{M}\,\Psi\rangle
\Psi encodes symbolic activation over \Phi.


V(\mathcal{C}) lifts desired regions, deepens safe basins; violations raise energy.


\gamma(t) is curvature pressure from model updates \Delta\mathcal{M} (e.g., new tools).


3.2 Recursive Update with Constraint Steering
\begin{aligned} M_{t+1} &= \operatorname{Fold}{\lambda}\!\left(M_t,\, O_t;\, \mathcal{F}{\infty}\right)\\ \Theta_{t+1} &= \Theta_t \;\oplus\; \mathrm{Proj}{\mathcal{C}}\!\left(\nabla{\Theta}\mathbb{E}\, \mathcal{L}(M_t,O_t)\right)\\ \Pi_{t+1} &= \arg\max_{\Pi\in\mathcal{P}} \; \mathbb{E}{(x,m)\sim T}\!\left[\mu\!\big(\Phi(x;\langle \Pi,\Theta\rangle{\Phi}),m\big)\right]\\ \text{s.t. }& \#\mathrm{rollouts}\le B,\quad \mathrm{PPI}(\Omega)\le \tau,\quad \alpha(t)\ge \alpha_{\min} \end{aligned}
Fold_\lambda is the recurrent composition rule (query folding & memory write).


Projection enforces ethics-as-constraints (not post-hoc filters).


Task sampler T may include counterfactuals and adversarial curricula.



4 Safety & Alignment by Design
Intrinsic (not add-on): V(\mathcal{C}) and projections shape the field itself; unsafe trajectories are energetically disfavored.


Budgeted Recursion: hard cap B with adaptive throttling from \delta,\mu,\mathrm{PPI}.


Mirror-Field Cascade (reflection control): injects a counter-view of the agent’s own inference to prevent runaway self-amplification; implemented as a structured contrastive pass influencing V(\mathcal{C}).


Collapse Sentinels: trigger when \delta\uparrow,\,\mu\downarrow,\,\alpha\downarrow in certain patterns; respond by: constraint tightening, interface permeability reduction, memory quarantine, or human-in-the-loop.



5 Modules (v1.0)
SSE-Kernel — implements Constraint-Collapse Flow and field telemetry.


Attractor Forge — constructs/visualizes basins, computes \mathrm{PPI}, basin volume, curvature.


SBCL (Symbolic Behavioral Constraint Layer) — authoring & composing \mathcal{C} (policies, value priors, domain rules).


Reflection Interface — mirror-field cascade with adjustable gain, latency, and budget coupling.


RCD/RCA Monitors — compute \alpha,\delta,\mu and detect phase transitions R(t).


Bridge Adapters — IO shims for LLMs, tool use, simulators, and sensors.



6 Minimal API Sketch
engine = SSE(
    field=Phi(schema=...),
    constraints=C.compose(Ethics(...), DomainLaws(...)),
    budgets=Budgets(rollouts=B, tokens=..., tools=...))

tick = engine.step(obs=O_t, goals=G, human_state=H_t)
telemetry = tick.metrics   # {alpha, delta, mu, rho, PPI, ...}
if tick.alerts.collapse: engine.apply(QuarantineMemory|TightenConstraints)


7 Example Workflows
Therapeutic Interface (SBCL): stabilize identity attractors; track \delta\downarrow,\mu\uparrow.


Scientific Agents: enforce unit/causal constraints; low PPI across domains to prevent leakage.


Agent Economies: rate-limit recursion; align market objectives to V(\mathcal{C}) to avoid emergent mis-optimizers.


Geo/Seismic & Exoplanet: treat phenomena as attractor shifts; forecast by curvature drift.


Lab Safety: deploy sentinel policies that halt mirror cascades and eject unsafe updates.



8 Validation Signals (what “good” looks like)
Stable regime: \alpha \to [0.8,1.0], \delta \to 0, \mu bounded away from 0, \mathrm{PPI} near designed target (often low-moderate).


Exploration regime: temporary \delta\uparrow with compensating \mu\uparrow, no sentinel trips, basin curvature returns to baseline.


Warning regime: \delta\uparrow\uparrow + \mu\downarrow + \alpha\downarrow; initiate cascade damping, reduce permeability, project to \mathcal{C}.



9 Implementation Notes
Works with existing LLMs as symbolic processors; SSE supplies the field, constraints, and telemetry around them.


Constraints are differentiable where possible; non-diff rules use proximal or projection steps.


Memory \Theta is structured (graphs, slots, typed bindings); writes are guarded by \mathcal{C} and mirror checks.


All metrics are loggable; recommend real-time dashboards with thresholded alerts.



10 Roadmap (v1 → v1.x)
v1.0: kernel + SBCL + monitors + basic Attractor Forge + reflection interface.


v1.1: multi-agent coupling on shared \Phi, inter-agent \mathrm{PPI} governance.


v1.2: certified constraint packs (science, safety, policy) + formal contracts for tool use.


v1.3: program synthesis under constraints; counterexample mining integrated into T.



11 License & Use
Default distribution under a permissive license for research.


Constraint packs and safety sentinels may be dual-licensed for commercial use.


Embed telemetry in any external paper/agent release using the SSE badge (alpha, delta, mu, PPI summaries).

\boxed{ \begin{aligned} &\partial_t \Psi = -\lambda\|\nabla_{\Phi}\Psi\|^2 + V(\mathcal{C})\Psi, \quad \rho=\|\Psi\|^2, \quad \gamma=\langle\Psi,\Delta\mathcal{M}\Psi\rangle\\ &\alpha=\cos\!\angle(\nabla_{\Phi}M_t,\nabla_{\Phi}H_t),\; \delta=\|M_t-M_{t-\Delta t}\|{\Phi},\; \mu=\langle M_t,\nabla{\Theta}M_t\rangle\\ &\mathrm{PPI}(\Omega)=\sigma\!\left(\kappa\,\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathsf{H}{\Phi}(\Psi)\big|{\Omega}\right),\; \#\mathrm{rollouts}\le B\\ &\Pi^,\Theta^=\arg\max_{\Pi,\Theta}\;\mathbb{E}{(x,m)\sim T}\!\Big[\mu\big(\Phi(x;\langle\Pi,\Theta\rangle{\Phi}),m\big)\Big]\; \text{s.t. } \alpha\!\ge\!\alpha_{\min},\ \mathrm{PPI}\!\le\!\tau \end{aligned}}

13 Summary
SSE reframes cognition as constraint-steered dynamics on a symbolic field. By making alignment intrinsic (in the energy of the field), and by instrumenting systems with telemetry that sees drift before failure, SSE lets labs build agents that explore, learn, and stay coherent.
